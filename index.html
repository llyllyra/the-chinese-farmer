           <h2> The story</h1>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <blockquote>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</blockquote> The farmer said, <blockquote>“<em>Maybe</em>.”</blockquote> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <blockquote>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</blockquote> The farmer again said, <blockquote>“<em>Maybe</em>.”</blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <blockquote>“ Ohdear, that’s too <span class="bad"></span>bad</span>,”</blockquote> and the farmer responded, <blockquote>“<em>Maybe</em>.”</blockquote> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <blockquote>“Isn’t that great!”</blockquote> Again, he said, <blockquote>“<em>Maybe</em>.”</blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</p>

           <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p> <span class="good">good</span> and <span class="bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
